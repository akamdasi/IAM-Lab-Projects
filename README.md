# 🛡️ 100 Hands-On IAM Projects – Portfolio by Akam Dasi

Welcome to my Identity and Access Management (IAM) Lab Portfolio — a collection of **100 real-world, hands-on projects** completed as part of a 3-month intensive training plan to prepare for **Senior IAM Engineer** and **IAM Architect** roles.

Each project focuses on a core component of enterprise IAM, including:
- Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
- SSO (SAML/OIDC), MFA, Conditional Access
- Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- B2B/B2C Identity Federation
- Kubernetes RBAC & Secrets Management
- Terraform / PowerShell IAM Automation
- Azure Sentinel Threat Detection
- Role Engineering & Identity Governance
- Hybrid IAM with Entra Connect and ADFS
